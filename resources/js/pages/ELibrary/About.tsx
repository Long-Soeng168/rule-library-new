                                and Economics has developed rapidly with the implementation of modern software to manage the library's operations. As
                                a result, the library initially used a world-class library management system called Koha , which made library
                                management easier with book search, book data storage, loan management, and many other important functions. At the
                                same time, the library has also prepared an E-Library project , through which students and professors can easily use
                                the library of the Royal University of Law and Economics via the Internet.
